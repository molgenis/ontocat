OntoCAT Java API Release Notes
==============================

Version 0.9.9.2 / / /
	Added <userIds> <obsoleteParent> fields to Bioportal's OntologyBean
	FIX for the inability of using encoded slashes in the URL proper when querying Bioportal
	Now passing them as string parameters, q=? pattern
	Added xrefs to annotations returned from OLS

Version 0.9.9.1 30/9/2011
	FIX: starting term now added on the appropriate side of a path in BioPortal
	Updated BP signatures to include isObsolete fields
	Now termpath will throw an exception if an unresolvable term is found rather 
	than adding null to the path
	Modified namespaces behaviour to be more consistent throughout and fixed
	os.getOntologies().get(0).getOntologyAccession() so that it can be used
	as ontologyAccesion (see example 18)

Version 0.9.9 30/08/2011
	Interface change, added getURI to OntologyTerm
	Updated BP OntologyBean's signature and changed warning on new fields to DEBUG level
	Minor fix for empty term paths causing an exception

Version 0.9.8 31/05/2011
	Added GNU and Apache license boilerplates to all source files
	
	Modified distribution package by adding a top-level directory to avoid polluting 
	the directory that it is unzipped into
	
	OntoCAT's default apikey is now added to all BioPortal REST queries
	(note that you can also use your private apikey by supplying it in the 
	alternative BioportalOntologyService constructor)
	
	As per OBO Foundry policy (http://www.obofoundry.org/id-policy.shtml)
	OBO accessions are now translated by OWL API into URIs. This results in
	colons (:) being replaced with underscores (_) in the accessions. In line with
	this policy OntoCAT leaves the accessions as is, however it it still possible
	to getTerm() by its OBO accession, e.g. GO:0000003, but the accession 
	on the retrieved corresponding OntologyTerm will be GO_0000003. 

Version 0.9.7.7 17/05/2011
	FIX: ReasonedFileOntologyService basic constructor was not being instantiated properly
	
	FIX: Another work-around for OWL API 3.2.2 introducing invalid object properties
	URIs and messing up with the reasoner. The new approach relies on removing unused 
	object properties rather than merging as it is difficult to predict which properties
	to merge with OBO namespace introducing another unknown into the object propery URI
	
	UPDATE: Updated BioPortal's OntologyBean signature with userAcl field

Version 0.9.7.6 26/04/2011
	FIX: Manual fix for EFO synonyms and definitions to be parsable through BioPortal
	
	Added an internal cache to BioportalOntologyService that stores the results of
	recent queries (LRU type, 100 queries capacity)
	
	Modified the way BioportalOntologyService accesses hierarchy to reuse ConceptBean
	rather than calling parents/children signatures (considerable speed improvement due
	to caching)

Version 0.9.7.5 05/03/2011
	UPDATE: Updated the OWL API dependency to 3.2.2, which removed the need to fix
	the "owlapi" prefixes in OBO ontologies, but the OBO parser now incorrectly
	loads the object property IRIs, which required a different fix.
	
	FIX: Added an override for the arbitrary limit in the SAXParser of 64k entity expansions
	when using RDFXMLParser (error message: The parser has encountered more than "64,000" 
	entity expansions)
	
Version 0.9.7.4 31/03/2011
	The owlapi prefix is now removed from OBO term accessions when using the 
	ReasonedFileOntologyService

Version 0.9.7.3 23/03/2011
	FIX: ReasonedFileOntologyService was incorrectly calculating root terms
	
	FIX: ReasonedFileOntologyService now also computes relationships for OBO ontologies
	
Version 0.9.7.2 15/03/2011
	FIX: ReasonedFileOntologyService was missing the OntologyService interface implementation
	preventing it from being decorated
	 
Version 0.9.7.1 11/03/2011/

Version 0.9.7 9/03/2011/
	Change in OntologyService.getRelations signature from return Map<String, List<String>> 
	to Map<String,Set<OntologyTerm>>  
	
	Added ReasonedFileOntologyService, which uses the HermiT reasoner to infer hierarchy and relations
	
	Added support for individuals/instances/particulars to FileOntologyService
	
	FIX: OLS.getRelations() now returns a proper result set

Version 0.9.6.3 9/02/2011
	Removed system.exit() statements that were causing problems in external applications

Version 0.9.6.2 8/02/2011
	Added LocalisedFileService that harmonises and overwrites ontology accessions for FileOntologyService
	
	Updated to latest BioPortal REST signature
	
	FIX: property search was case sensitive in FileOntologyService
	
	FIX: sorting by similarity now includes properties in BioportalOntologyService and FileOntologyService

Version 0.9.6.1 24/11/2010
	Rolled out similarity enabled search (Levenshtein distance across normalised strings)
	
	Updated to the newest BioPortal ontology bean xml signature

	FIX: Various fixes to javadoc

Version 0.9.5, 22/9/2010
	Added support for labels being part of the class URI
